Blue Swarm
=========

A genetic video game

You can [see the current thing running](http://xxx.4orsi.it/nw/blueswarm/)
but for now it will just show a different generated shape every time you
reload the page.

The algorithm can turn arbitrary sequences of symbols (a "genetic code")
into shapes that feature the same repeated patterns we see in real lifeforms;
redundant sequences in the code also quantitatively affect the shape.
